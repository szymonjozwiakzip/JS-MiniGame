# JSprojectOne

Welcome in my first JS project!

In this simple web app you are fighting with a monster by attacks and strong attack. Every attack is based on random values in compartments. Remember, that monster got a bit bigger compartments than you. Luckily you can also use HEAL button but you have to remember, that monster will attack you at the same time as you will use HEAL. In some cases, monster can attack you harder than your healing value. You have also one extra bonus life - when you are about to die, bonus life saves you and then you have extra chance to win! You can also use SHOW LOG button and look at commands in console. Have fun!


This project is inspired by JS course that I am doing now.
